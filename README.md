# SharedCache

Redis cache framework for Sitecore XM/XP

## Introduction

The SharedCache framework is an extension to the build in caches in Sitecore. It offers the ability for multiple CD instances to share a single "shared cache" (hosted either in the filesystem or in Redis). In a large Sitecore solution with multiple CD servers this will result in improved performance as the cached data from one instance can be reused by other instances. This is especially important if the number of CD instances vary, as new CD instaces will prefetch the cache from the shared cache.

The SharedCache framework offers two kinds of Sitecore caches: 

The `SharedHtmlCache` is a replacement for the build in memory HTML cache offered by Sitecore. The `SharedHtmlCache` still primarily uses memory as a cache storage, but will use a shared cache as a second level cache. This has been implemented in the `SharedCache.Html` project. This project also allow a single site in Sitecore to use multiple HTML caches which can improve performance on large sites as a publish does not nessasary needs to clear all cached HTML content.

Also, the SharedCache framework offers three _shared custom caches_ (`SharedCustomCache`, `SharedCustomListCache` and `SharedCustomDictionaryCache`). These caches can be used to store object, list of objects and dictionaries of objects of any serializable type. They can be used as a replacement for the custom caches provided by Sitecore, and offers the possiblity to use a second level shared cache. These cache are implemented in the `SharedCache.Custom` project, and include advanced option to control the clearing of a cache based on the publishing of items.

### SharedCache.Core

Fundamental to the functionality of the SharedCache framework is `StringCache` implementions in the `SharedCache.Core` project. A `StringCache` is a simple cache that stores strings, lists of strings of dictionaries of strings. The SharedCache framework offers StringCache implementations using the HTTP session, the HTTP cache, the file system or Redis as a storage mechanism. The `StringCache` are not meant to be used directly, but to be injected into either a `SharedHtmlCache` or one of the _shared custom caches_ as a second level cache. This means that if either the `SharedHtmlCache` or one of the shared custom caches does not directly (in memory) has a requested cache key, it will look into the second level cache for the same key. This means that the shared caches still primary stores values in memory, and will only look in Redis is the local memory cache fails to produce a result. 

### Supported storage mechanisms

The `FileStringCache` uses the file system as a storage. It is a rather crude implementation, storing using keys as file names, and is not optimized for production use. To avoid problems with keys containing illegal characters, the `IndexedStringCache` is offered as an wrapper for the `FileStringCache`. It stores keys in a index, circumventing problems with illegal characters. These two string caches are provided to help local testing or to use a shared cache in a situation where Redis is not available (e.g. on a local developers machine). 

The `HttpCacheStringCache` uses the HttpCache as a storage mechanism, where as the `HttpSessionStringCache` uses the Session storage. Both are in-memory only, and provided for some of the same reasons as the `FileStringCache` â€“ it allows running simulating a shared cache on a local machine.

Finally the `RedisStringCache` offers the same capabilities as the other string caches, but uses a Redis database. 
When you create a string cache, you will always provide a name for the string cache. Becuase all the string caches uses a shared storage (e.g. the file system or a Redis database), the `SharedCache.Core.StringCaches.Keys` namespace contains logic to wrap and unwrap keys. This allow two string caches to use the same Redis database, without risking key collisions. It also allow one string cache to be cleared without clearing other caches within the same storage.

## Shared custom caches

### Serialization

To support the storage of a object of any type into the second level string caches, the SharedCache uses JSON serialization. As the SharedHtmlCache already stored strings of HTML, this is relevant only for the shared custom caches. However, the cache mechanism can be overwritten for a specific shared custom cache by implementing the `SharedCache.Core.Serialization.ICacheSerializer<T>` interface:

```
namespace SharedCache.Core.Serialization
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Interface to implement serialization to the cache
    /// </summary>
    public interface ICacheSerializer<T>
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Deserializes the specified serialized value.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="serializedValue">The serialized value.</param>
        T Deserialize(string serializedValue);

        /// <summary>
        /// Serializes the specified object.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="obj">The object.</param>
        string Serialize(T obj);
    }
}
```

### Cache clearing

The shared custom cache supports cache clearing whenever a `item:saved`, `publish:end` or `publish:end:remote` event is trigged. In a normal scenario only the `publish:end` event would clear the second level cache, whereas all events will clear the local memory cache. The logic to determine whether a specific save or publish event should clear a particular cache is encapsulated in a `ClearPredicate`:

```
namespace SharedCache.Custom.ClearPredicates
{
    using Sitecore.Configuration;
    using Sitecore.Data;
    using Sitecore.Data.Events;
    using Sitecore.Data.Items;
    using Sitecore.Events;

    /// <summary>
    /// Abstract class for a clear predicate
    /// </summary>
    public abstract class ClearPredicate
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets a value indicating whether to clear on global publish.
        /// </summary>
        public abstract bool ClearOnGlobal { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets a value indicating whether use site name as cache key
        /// </summary>
        public abstract bool UseSiteNameAsCacheKey { get; } 

        /// <summary>
        /// Determines whether to clear the cache.
        /// </summary>
        public abstract bool DoClear(Item item);
    }
}
```

Of special notice is the property `ClearOnGlobal` and `UseSiteNameAsCacheKey`. The `ClearOnGlobal` determines whether the cache should be cleared for items not belonging to a site (items not from `Sitecore/Content`). The `UseSiteNameAsCacheKey` is a bit special. Normally, if this is set for false, the entire cache is cleared is the `DoClear` returns true. However, I often use the custom shared cache in a way so that each site has a key within the cache (e.g. using the `SharedCustomListCache` to contain a list of some objects for each site). In that case I do not want to clear the entire cache upon a publish, I simply want to remove the particular key for the published site. If setting the `UseSiteNameAsCacheKey` to true, this is what is going to happen for items that belong to a particular site (global items will still clear the entire cache if ClearOnGlobal is true).
